Not too much of an update to share today, I just felt like I haven't wrote much in a bit and sometimes I just need to write ...something. Anyway - Today I put some of the Python utilities that I created along with ChatGPT's help out on [a GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Freeze/photography_util).

These will 100% need some adaptation for your environment, and I'm making another one of those promises to myself that I put in writing here that I will continuously update these until I feel that they are where I need them to be. There are a lot of hardcoded variables in those scripts that will not be useful in your environment. The README.md file in the repository gives an explanation of what files do what. My near-future plans are to make this into a proper package so I don't need so many scripts for doing everything.

Anyway - just figured I'd share some of the utilities I use to try to maintain my [lightweight photo portfolio](https://hldn.io/portfolio). I was planning to write about my experience upgrading my Xfinity internet to gigabit but it took so freakin' long yesterday and drained me that I ended up not wanting to write about it quite yet. My plan going in was to write a blog post about the experience because I knew it was going to suck, so at least I was successful in that fashion!
