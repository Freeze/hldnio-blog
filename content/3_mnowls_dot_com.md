You might notice a few links on the left to a few various simple web tools I have put together. The one I want to talk about today is the [Owl Tracker](https://mnowls.com/owls.html).

**What Is the Owl Tracker?**
The Owl Tracker is a tool that uses the [eBird](https://ebird.org) API to pull owl locations and put them on a map!

**Why? Doesn't eBird Do That Already?**
Yup! I am a photographer. I like taking pictures with my camera. Sometimes I like those pictures to be of owls. When I am feeling inspired to go take a picture of an owl, the last thing I feel like doing is firing up various eBird tabs/web browser apps and typing in each owl, making sure my date range is correct, etc. So, I made this tool.

**Okay, So You're Still Describing What eBird Does, Why Is This Different?**
Mnowls is meant to be one webpage. There are a few buttons on that webpage, but not too many. Mnowls does not want you to leave mnowls. The tool was designed to be really simple. A header that tells us how stale our data is, a map in the middle that shows where owls are found on the map, a tool for selecting owl species on the left side of the page, a list of sightings, in order of age, on the bottom, and a footer with attribution to the resource that made this project possible. Click the owl you want to see, locations show on the map.

**Cool, I Think I Get It!**
Great. Any other questions?

**Is It Complete? You Ready to Ship This Thing?**
Nope! Check out my [todo list](https://mnowls.com/todo/mnowls.html). I was going to put it in this post, but I think the idea of maintaining a todo list in the middle of a random blog post sucks, so it's at that link.

Thanks for listening.
