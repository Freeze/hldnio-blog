you might notice a few links on the left to a few various simple web tools i have put together. the one i want to talk about today is the [owl tracker](https://mnowls.com/owls.html).

*what is the owl tracker?*
- the owl tracker is a tool that uses the [eBird](https://ebird.org) API to pull owl locations and put them on a map!

*why? doesn't eBird do that already?*
- yup! i am a photographer. i like taking pictures with my camera. sometimes i like those pictures to be of owls. when i am feeling inspired to go take a picture of an owl, the last thing i feel like doing is firing up various eBird tabs/web browser apps and typing in each owl, making sure my date range is correct, etc. so, i made this tool.

*okay, so you're still describing what eBird does, why is this different?*
- mnowls is meant to be one webpage. there are a few buttons on that webpage, but not too many. mnowls does not want you to leave mnowls. the tool was designed to be really simple. a header that tells us how stale our data is, a map in the middle that shows where owls are found on the map, a tool for selecting owl species on the left side of the page, a list of sightings, in order of age, on the bottom, and a footer with attribution to the resource that made this project possible. click the owl you want to see, locations show on map.

*cool, i think i get it!* 
great. any other questions? 

*is it complete? you ready to ship this thing?*
nope! check out my [todo list](https://mnowls.com/todo/mnowls.html). i was going to put it in this post, but i think the idea of maintaining a todo list in the middle of a random blog post sucks, so it's at that link.

thanks for listening.
